## MyPlaces (Backend)

Simple API/Socket communication for MyPlaces!!!

### Setup

- `npm start` to bootstrap the application into `localhost:5001`
- `npm test` to run the unit tests (TODO!!)

### Libraries used

- `Hapi` as the server framework
- `Socket.io` for the real time communication
- `Sequelize` as the DB ORM
- `Postgresql` as the database for the app
- `Heroku` for deployment


#### - Notes
First time using Hapi and sequelize, hapi was a breeze! sequelize is cool but the documentation not that much
This took about 1-2 hours to make (reading docs was an hour I think hahaha)
